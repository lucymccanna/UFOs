# UFOs

## Overview of Project
In this project, a dynamic webpage was created by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page to present UFO Sighting data and allow user inputs to filter the data for a refined search. The webpage was further customized and styled using CSS and Bootstrap.  

## Results
On the webpage, there are five fields that users can utilize to enter search criteria: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape [see Image 1]. 

Users may apply the filters in any order. There are placeholder examples in each search box that informs the user of an expected entry and format. For example, dates should be entered in m/dd/yyyy format and text should be entered in all lowercase (see Image 2).   

For example, to search for any UFO Sightings that occured on January 11th, 2010 in Forida the user would enter '1/11/2010' in the Date search box and 'fl' in the State search box (see Image 3).

## Summary

While the website is visually appealing, there is a drawback of having all the data displayed on one page. To view the data at the very bottom of the page without using filters, the user must scroll all the way down which can be time consuming. For further development, I recommend displaying 10-15 records per page and adding 'back' and 'next' page buttons that the user can click to navigate through the data. I also reccommend adding a new filter for Duration of the UFO sighting.
